  * The [page] struct encapsulates the data for an Ogg page.
  *
  * Ogg pages are the fundamental unit of framing and interleave in an ogg
  * bitstream. They are made up of packet segments of 255 bytes each. There can
  * be as many as 255 packet segments per page, for a maximum page size of a
  * little under 64 kB. This is not a practical limitation as the segments can be
  * joined across page boundaries allowing packets of arbitrary size. In practice
  * pages are usually around 4 kB.

module Page :
sig
  (** A page is a header and a body *)
  type t = string*string

  (** 
    * Returns the unique serial number for the logical bitstream of this page. 
    * Each page contains the serial number for the logical bitstream that it belongs to.*)
  val serialno : t -> nativeint

  (** 
    * Indicates whether this page is at the end of the logical bitstream. *)
  val eos : t -> bool

  (** 
    * Indicates whether this page is at the begining of the logical bitstream. *)
  val bos : t -> bool

  (**
    * Indicates whether this page contains packet data which has been 
    * continued from the previous page. *)
  val continued : t -> bool

  (** 
    * Returns the number of packets that are completed on this page. 
    * If the leading packet is begun on a previous page, but ends on this page, it's counted. 
    *
    * If a page consists of a packet begun on a previous page, and a new packet begun 
    * (but not completed) on this page, the return will be:
    *
    * [packets page] will return [1],
    * [continued paged] will return [true]
    *
    * If a page happens to be a single packet that was begun on a previous page, 
    * and spans to the next page (in the case of a three or more page packet), the return will be:
    *
    * [packets page] will return 0,
    * [continued page] will return [true].*)
  val packets : t -> int

  (** 
    * This function returns the version of ogg_page used in this page. 
    * In current versions of libogg, all ogg_page structs have the same version, 
    * so [0] should always be returned. *)
  val version : t -> int

  (**
    * Returns the exact granular position of the packet data contained at the end of this page. 
    *
    * This is useful for tracking location when seeking or decoding. 
    *
    * For example, in audio codecs this position is the pcm sample number and 
    * in video this is the frame number.*)
  val granulepos : t -> Int64.t

  (**
    * Returns the sequential page number. 
    * 
    * This is useful for ordering pages or determining when pages have been lost. *)

  (**
    * Checksums an ogg_page. *)
  val set_checksum : t -> unit

module Sync :
sig
  type t

  (** 
    * This function is used to initialize a [Sync.t] to a known initial value 
    * in preparation for manipulation of an Ogg bitstream. 
    *
    * The function passed is used to fill the stream with new data. It receives a number of bytes to read
    * and returns a string read and its size. *)
  val create : (int -> string*int) -> t

  (**
    * Wrapper around [create] to open a file as the ogg stream. *)
  val create_from_file : string -> (t*Unix.file_descr)

  (** 
    * Read a page from [Sync.t] 
    *
    * Raises [End_of_stream] if the reading function returned an empty string. 
    * Raises [Out_of_sync] if data is not synced and some byte where skiped. *)
  val read : t -> Page.t

  (** 
    * This function is used to reset the internal counters of the 
    * [Sync.t] to initial values. 
    *
    * [read_func] is optional and is a new function to read new data. *)
  val reset : ?read_func:(int -> string*int) -> t -> unit

  (** 
    * This function synchronizes the ogg_sync_state struct to the next ogg_page.
    * 
    * This is useful when seeking within a bitstream. page_seek will synchronize 
    * to the next page in the bitstream and return information about how many bytes 
    * we advanced or skipped in order to do so. *)
  val seek : t -> Page.t
end


module Stream :
sig
  (**
    * The [stream] values track the current encode/decode state of the
    * current logical bitstream.
    *)
  type stream

  (**
    * A data packet to pass to the decoder *)
  type packet

  (**
    * Create a [stream].
    *)
  val create : ?serial:nativeint -> unit -> stream

  (** 
    * Get a stream's serial number.
    *)
  val serialno : stream -> nativeint

  (** Returns true if the end of stream has been reached. *)
  val eos : stream -> bool

  (**
    * This function forms packets into pages. Internally,
    * it assembles the accumulated packet bodies into an Ogg page
    * suitable for writing to a stream.
    *
    * If no [fill] argument is passed, this function will only return 
    * a page when a "reasonable" amount of packet data is available. 
    * Normally this is appropriate since it limits the overhead of the 
    * Ogg page headers in the bitstream. 
    *
    * If a [fill] argument is passed, this function will return a page when at
    * least four packets have been accumulated and accumulated packet data meets
    * or exceeds the specified number of bytes, and/or when the accumulated
    * packet data meets/exceeds the maximum page size regardless of accumulated
    * packet count.
    *
    * Call [flush_page] if immediate  page generation is desired. This 
    * may be occasionally necessary, for example, to limit the temporal 
    * latency of a variable bitrate stream.
    *)
  val get_page : ?fill:int -> stream -> Page.t

  (** 
    * This function adds a complete page to the bitstream. 
    *
    * In a typical decoding situation, this function would be called after 
    * using [Sync.read] to create a valid [Page.t] 
    * 
    * Raises [Bad_data] if the serial number of the page did not match the 
    * serial number of the bitstream, or the page version was incorrect. *)
  val put_page : stream -> Page.t -> unit

  (**
    * This function assembles a data packet for output 
    * to the codec decoding engine.
    *
    * Each successive call returns the next complete packet built from those segments.
    * In a typical decoding situation, this should be used after calling 
    * [put_page] to submit a page of data to the bitstream. 
    *
    * This function should *not* be used. Because of ocaml's paradigm, it is necessary 
    * to copy each packet since they are only valid until this function is called again.
    * When dealing with many packets, this will lead to multiple unecessary memory allocation 
    * and desallocation.
    *
    * Raises [Not_enough_data] if more data is needed and another page should be submitted.
    *
    * Raises [Out_of_sync]  if we are out of sync and there is a gap in the data. *)
  val get_packet : stream -> packet

  (**
    * This function assembles a data packet for output
    * to the codec decoding engine without advancing the stream.
    *
    * Raises [Not_enough_data] if more data is needed and another page should be submitted.
    *
    * Raises [Out_of_sync]  if we are out of sync and there is a gap in the data *)
  val peek_packet : stream -> packet

  (** This function picks up the granule position
    * of the next packet in the stream without advancing it.
    *
    * Raises [Not_enough_data] if more data is needed and another page should be submitted.
    *
    * Raises [Out_of_sync]  if we are out of sync and there is a gap in the data *)
  val peek_granulepos : stream -> Int64.t

  (** This function discards the next packet in the stream.
    *
    * Raises [Not_enough_data] if more data is needed and another page should be submitted.
    *
    * Raises [Out_of_sync]  if we are out of sync and there is a gap in the data *)
  val skip_packet : stream -> unit

  (**
    * This function submits a packet to the bitstream for page encapsulation. 
    * After this is called, more packets can be submitted, or pages can be written out.
    *
    * This function is provided to ease ogg strea multiplexing, where packet submission
    * order is important. It should not be used to encoder further data. *)
  val put_packet : stream -> packet -> unit

  (**
    * This function checks for remaining packets inside the stream and forces
    * remaining packets into a page, regardless of the size of the page.
    *
    * This should only be used when you want to flush an undersized page from the
    * middle of the stream. Otherwise, [get_page] should always be used.
    *
    * This function can be used to verify that all packets have been flushed.
    *
    * Raises [Not_enough_data] if  all packet data has already been flushed into pages,
    * and there are no packets to put into the page.
    *)
