 (** Ogg stream demuxer *)

 (** This module provides a functional abstract API to 
   * decode and seek in Ogg streams.
   *
   * Decoders are also provided in ocaml-vorbis,
   * ocaml-speex, ocaml-schroedinger, ocaml-flac and
   * ocaml-theora.
   * 
   * Functions in this module are not thread safe! *)

(** {3 Exceptions } *)

exception Invalid_stream
exception Not_available

(* This exception has a different semantics than [Ogg.End_of_stream].
 * [Ogg.End_of_stream] is raised when end of data has been reached,
 * while this exception is raised when end of a logical stream has
 * been reached.. *)
exception End_of_stream

(** {3 Initialization functions } *)

(** Initiate a decoder with the given callbacks. 
  * [log] is an optional functioned used to 
  * return logged messages during the deocding
  * process. *)
val init : ?log:(string->unit) -> callbacks -> t 

(** Initiate a decoder from a given file name. *)
val init_from_file : ?log:(string->unit) -> string -> t*Unix.file_descr

(** Initate a decoder from a given [Unix.file_descriptor] *)
val init_from_fd : ?log:(string->unit) -> Unix.file_descr -> t

(** Get the Ogg.Sync handler associated to 
  * the decoder. Use only if know what you are doing. *)
val get_ogg_sync : t -> Ogg.Sync.t

(** Reset encoder, try to parse a new sequentialized stream.
  * To use when end_of_stream has been reached. *)
val reset : t -> unit

(** Consume all remaining pages of the current
  * stream. This function may be called to skip
  * a sequentialized stream but it may be quite
  * CPU intensive if there are many pages remaining.. 
  * 
  * [eos dec] is [true] after this call. *)
val abort : t -> unit

(** [true] if the decoder has reached the end of each
  * logical streams and all data has been decoded.
  *
  * If you do not plan on decoding some data, 
  * you should use [drop_track] to indicate it
  * to the decoder. Otherwise, [eos] will return
  * [false] until you have decoded all data. *)
val eos : t -> bool

(** Get all decodable tracks available. *)
val get_tracks : t -> track list

(** Get the first available audio and
  * video tracks and drop the other one. *)
val get_standard_tracks : t -> standard_tracks

(** Update a given record of standard tracks. You should
  * use this after a [reset] to update the standard tracks
  * with the newly created tracks. *)
val update_standard_tracks : t -> standard_tracks -> unit

(** Remove all tracks of the given type. *)
val drop_track : t -> track -> unit

(** {3 Information functions} *)

(** Get informations about the
  * audio track. *)
val audio_info : t -> track -> audio_info * metadata

(** Get informations about the
  * video track. *)

(** Get the sample_rate of the track
  * of that type. Returns a pair [(numerator,denominator)]. *)

(** {3 Seeking functions} *)

(** Returns [true] if the decoder
  * can be used with the [seek] function. *)
val can_seek : t -> bool

(** Seek to an absolute or relative position in seconds.
  *
  * Raises [Not_available] if seeking is
  * not possible.
  *
  * Raises [End_of_stream] if the end of
  * current stream has been reached while
  * seeking. You may call [reset] in this
  * situation to see if there is a new seqentialized
  * stream available. 
  * 
  * Returns the time actually reached, either in 
  * relative time or absolute time. *)
val seek : ?relative:bool -> t -> float -> float

(** {3 Decoding functions} *)

(** Decode audio data, if possible. 
  * Decoded data is passed to the second argument. 
  *
  * Raises [End_of_stream] if all stream have ended.
  * In this case, you can try [reset] to see if there is a
  * new sequentialized stream. *)
val decode_audio : t -> track -> (audio_data -> unit) -> unit

(** Decode video data, if possible. 
  * Decoded data is passed to the second argument. 
  *
  * Raises [End_of_stream] if all streams have ended.
  * In this case, you can try [reset] to see if there is a
  * new sequentialized stream. *)

      * that is should use to pull data packets. *)

(** Type for a generic logical stream decoder. *)
type decoders =
    | Video of (video_info,video_data) decoder
    | Audio of (audio_info,audio_data) decoder

(** Type used to register a new decoder. First
  * element is a function used to check if the initial [Ogg.Stream.packet]
  * of an [Ogg.Stream.stream] matches the format decodable by this decoder.
  * Second element is a function that instanciates the actual decoder
  * using the initial [Ogg.Stream.stream] used to pull data packets for the
  * decoder. *)
